Nothing new, just a minor mapping update and changed target frameworks according to the .NET release lifecycle.

### Changed
* Now also targeting .NET 9 according to supported versions in the [.NET release lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
* No longer targeting .NET 6 and .NET 7 (can be still used thanks to .NET Standard)
* Updated mapping to 5.25.0.1
