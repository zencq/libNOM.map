A few changes have been accumulated for this one: .NET 8 is targeted directly,
pre-releases can be included in mapping updates, and there is of course an update
for the mapping itself.

### Added
* Now targeting .NET 8 as per the [.NET release lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
* A version property for the used mapping (built-in or downloaded)
* A new setting to decide whether pre-releases should be included in the mapping updates

### Changed
* Bump Octokit from 7.1.0 to 9.1.2
* Updated mapping to 4.50.0.1
