This one adds the possibility to map a single keys and changes the settings behavior.

### Added
* New method `GetMappedKeyOrInput` to map a single key

### Changed
* Existing *mapping.json* is now loaded when changing the `Settings` and therefore the property has been replaced by a getter and a setter
